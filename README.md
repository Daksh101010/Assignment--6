Task- CALCULATOR USING TKINTER

This project is a simple calculator made using Python and Tkinter. Tkinter is used to create a window where the calculator appears on the screen. The calculator has buttons for numbers, basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, an equal button to get the result, and a clear button to erase everything.
When a user clicks any number or operator button, that value is shown on the display area of the calculator. The display works like a small screen that shows what the user is typing. When the equal button is pressed, the calculator evaluates the full expression and shows the final answer. If the user enters an invalid expression, the calculator displays an error message instead of crashing.
The clear button removes all the input so the user can start a new calculation. Overall, this project shows how Python can be used to build simple graphical applications that interact with users easily.
